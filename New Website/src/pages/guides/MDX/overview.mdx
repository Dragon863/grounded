# Grounded PCB Grant - Get up to $250 for a PCB

***

Every student will receive up to $250 to cover PCB manufacturing costs, and join a community of peers â€” some more beginner and some more experienced.

## Requirements

Every design/submission needs to meet the following constraints to be approved:

* Unique and open-source design
* Must be orderable on JLCPCB or other [approved vendor](https://github.com/hackclub/OnBoard/blob/main/docs/VENDORS.md)
* Must be in high school or younger and show proof of school enrollment to submit

## Getting Started

### 1. Join `#electronics` on Slack!

Our [`#electronics`](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0587U78RK4) channel is where the party is getting started!
Sign up to our community via [this link](https://hackclub.com/slack/?event=onboard).

### 2. Design a Board!

Most people reading this will be new to PCB design, so we've made a simple tutorial on making an example board.

Check out our [PCB tutorials](https://jams.hackclub.com/tag/pcb).

*If you get stuck or want more example projects, post in the Slack channel.*

*NOTE: The price limit is $250 for PCB's made in EasyEDA but only $50 for PCB's made in KiCad*

### 3. Upload to a Vendor and Take a Screenshot

Upload your Gerber files to [JLCPCB.com](https://jlcpcb.com/) and take a screenshot after you finish checkout.
